              a Verus wallet that lives in your terminal
```

`pecu` is a command-line Verus wallet, and the flagship example app for the
[Verus Rust SDK](https://github.com/chainvue/verus-rust-sdk). It exists to show what
that SDK can do — keys, transparent sends, air-gapped signing, transaction decoding
and the full VerusID lifecycle — without a local `verusd`, without a wallet daemon,
and without ever handing a private key to anything.

It talks to the public **VRSCTEST** node at `https://api.verustest.net`. The node is
only ever asked questions and given finished transaction bytes.

Every command takes `--explain`, which prints the exact `verus-sdk` calls it made.
Reading the output is meant to teach you the SDK.

> **Status: early.** This is being built one milestone at a time. Commands that

## Install

Requires Rust 1.95 (the toolchain the SDK pins).

```sh
git clone <this repo> && cd verus-pecu-cli
cargo build --release
./target/release/pecu --help
```

There is no `just` dependency; the task runner is `make`:

```sh
make help        # list targets
make check       # fmt-check + clippy -D warnings + tests + build, all offline
make test        # offline tests only
make testnet     # the #[ignore]d tests that hit api.verustest.net
make run ARGS="doctor"
```

## Commands

| Command | Does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `pecu doctor` | Node reachability, chain tip, config paths, build info | M2 |
| `pecu key gen\|import\|list\|show\|export\|phrase` | Encrypted keystore (Argon2id + ChaCha20-Poly1305) | M3 |
| `pecu wallet balance\|utxos` | Spendable, immature and token balances | M4 |
| `pecu tx explain` | Says what every output in a transaction actually *is* | M4 |
| `pecu send` | Transparent sends, native and token | M5 |
| `pecu plan send` / `pecu sign` / `pecu broadcast` | The air-gap trio, over files or terminal QR codes | M6 |
| `pecu id show\|register\|update\|revoke\|recover` | VerusID lifecycle | M7 |
| `pecu id login\|publish\|read` | Sign-in with VerusID, and VDXF data | M8 |
| `pecu completions <shell>` | Shell completion script | ✅ done |

### Global flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Machine-readable output instead of the rendered UI |
| `--dry-run` | Build and sign, but never broadcast |
| `--explain` | Print the `verus-sdk` calls this command makes |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Answer yes to every confirmation |
| `--profile <NAME>` | Config profile (env: `PECU_PROFILE`) |
| `--node <URL>` | Override the endpoint (env: `VERUS_ENDPOINT`) |
| `--theme auto\|phosphor\|plain` | Phosphor on a TTY, plain when piped. `NO_COLOR` always wins |
| `-v`, `-vv` | More logging |

## Why the output looks like that

The house style is *phosphor*: green on black, box-drawing frames, dim labels and
bright values. It is deliberately readable when piped — `--theme plain` and
`NO_COLOR=1` both strip every escape, and `--json` bypasses the renderer entirely.

## Design notes

- **Keys never leave the machine.** The SDK is offline-first by construction: the
  transaction builders open no sockets. Signing happens locally; only finished bytes
  go to the node.
- **The SDK has no `generate()` on purpose** — the caller supplies entropy. That job
  belongs to the keystore, which is why `pecu key gen` exists rather than a library call.
- **Money is integer satoshis end to end.** No floats, anywhere.
- **The SDK dependency is pinned by commit.** It is pre-1.0 and not on crates.io, so
  "latest `main`" would not be a reproducible build. `pecu --version` prints the rev.

## Not in scope (yet)

Shielded/z-address operations, the currency launch wizard, marketplace offers, and a
live `watch` dashboard. They come after the transparent and identity paths are solid.
